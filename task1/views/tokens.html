            <h3>How to send both Access Token and Refresh Token to the Client-side</h3>
              <p class="tech-box-info">
                One of the recent difficult backend problem I solved was how to send the access token and the refresh token to 
                the client-side, The backend executes most of the business logic, knowing that you Application server (backend-codes)
                interacts with the web server and database server. With your web server now, you want a situation where a user will log in after 
                some time, not being logged in indefinitely, that is the importance of sending Access Tokens and Refresh Token to the client-side, so as 
                to verify a particular user and giving access if the verification is sucessfully, and you have to send this token to the browser in form of a cookies.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
              <h4>Install Json web token</h4>
              <p>The first thing to do is to install jwt (json-web-token) using the command -- <i>npm install jsonwebtoken</i> </p>

              <h4>Require the installed package to your working file</h4>
              <p>The next thing to do is to require the installed package -- <i>const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")</i></p>

              <h4>Access Token</h4>
              <p>You only want to send the access token after the user is authenticated, also you can decide to pass in the 
                some of the users details to the access token this helps in verification. <br> Also remember to create a .env
                file, this is where your ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET will reside
              </p>
              <img src="images/accessToken.PNG" alt="">
              <p>From the example given above, the username and password is gotten from the user,
                both are checked to ensure that the are filled out, also the username is checked to see if such username exist as a user in the
                database, the password is hashed, now the accessToken, using the <i>.sign</i> function from the jwt package
                I was able to send the users information in a UserInfo object, along side the ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET which is in the .env file and also the 
                lifespan of the access token
              </p>

              <h4>Refresh Token</h4>
              <p>After being logged in, the refresh token is issued as well, using the <i>.sign</i> function from the jwt, the username, along side the REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
                 and the lifespan. Usually the life span of refresh token is longer than that of the access Token
              </p>
              <img src="images/refreshToken.PNG" alt="">

              <h4>Cookies</h4>
              <p>Remember the refresh and access tokens will be send to your browser in form of a cookie, I ensured that i installed the cookie-parser <i>npm install cookie-parse</i>, require it 
                 in the server file -- <i>const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser")</i> this is a middleware that
                 enables you parse and manage cookies remember to use it -- <i>app.use(cookieParser())</i>. <br>
                 

            </p>
            <img src="images/webcookie.PNG" alt="">
            <p>The <i>res.cookie</i> enables you define various properties for the cookie, such as name "jwt", the refreshToken, etc.
               <b>Note</b> the cookie is set to httpOnly true, so the cookie can only be accessed by the
               browser and not accessible to javascript, and the maxAge is set has well.
            </p>

            <h4>Refresh Api</h4>
            <p>After you are logged in, the access token get expired at some point, so the browser will have to send a request to the server to verify the access token once again, if truly the user has access to that particular page/resources. 
                 So if the request token is not expired the refresh token automatically issue a new access token to the user, keeping the user logged in, but if the refresh token is expired, the refresh token api sends a 401 unauthorized status
                 which then kick the user out to be logged in again
          </p>
